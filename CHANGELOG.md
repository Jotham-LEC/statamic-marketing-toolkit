# Changelog

## Unreleased

Run `php artisan migrate` after updating: there are new tables.

### Added
- **Search and share preview** on every page's SEO tab: the Google result, the Facebook/LinkedIn/WhatsApp card and the X card, with title and description counters, drawn from the unsaved form by the site's own rules, including the generated share card.
- **Tools → SEO**: an overview of what the site serves, with links to the brand global and the report settings.
- **Dashboard widget** `seo`: the latest report's score and the most recent 404s.
- **Permissions**: `view seo`, `manage seo redirects`, `run seo reports`.
- **Redirects** (`seo_redirects`): exact and `*` wildcard sources with `$1` captures, 301, 302 or 410, applied only to addresses that would be a 404; hit counts; CSV import and export.
- **Automatic 301s** when published content moves (slug, date, tree position, with the pages under it; a wildcard rule for a moved mount page), without chains or loops. Saving a page whose address changes asks whether to add one.
- **404 log** (`seo_404s`): one row per path, capped, without bots or scanner probes, with a "Create redirect" action.
- **Reports** (`seo_reports`, `seo_report_pages`): every published page rendered inside the app and checked against eleven rules, scored per page and for the site; `php please seo:report`, a CP button, an optional schedule; settings under Tools → Addons → SEO.
- Documentation in `docs/`.

### Changed
- The preview's description target is 50–160 characters (it was 155), and both length targets come from the report settings.

### Fixed
- The SEO title's help text no longer contains a raw `<title>` tag, which the control panel rendered as the browser tab's title.

## 0.1.0 – 2026-10-05

First release.

- `<s:seo:meta />`: title, description, robots, canonical, Open Graph and X tags, verification codes, and one JSON-LD `@graph` (WebSite, publisher, WebPage, BreadcrumbList, Article, FAQPage, custom nodes).
- The `seo::seo` fieldset and the "SEO & brand" global set (`php please seo:install`).
- `/sitemap.xml` (with an index above 1,000 URLs), `/robots.txt`, `/humans.txt`.
- Generated share cards at `/og.png` and `/og/{uri}.png` with simonhamp/the-og, cached and cookie-free, with per-page text and template overrides and custom templates.
- Trailing-slash redirects (`seo.trailing_slash`).
- One extension point for per-site rules: a subclass of `JothamLec\Seo\SiteSeo`.
