/**
 * When the site answers a request with a 404, this middleware sends the visitor on if a redirect rule
 * matches, and otherwise counts the request in the 404 log. A page that exists always wins over a rule,
 * so a page that comes back takes its address back. The bookkeeping (hit counts and the log) runs in
 * terminate(), after the response has gone out. We don't use Laravel's defer(), because it runs only
 * where the app has Laravel 11's InvokeDeferredCallbacks middleware, which a site that keeps the older
 * app/Http/Kernel.php may lack, and the log would then stay empty.
