/**
 * This class holds the SEO rules. Each public method works out one value for
 * one page. A project extends this class, binds its subclass in its place in a
 * service provider (`$this->app->bind(SiteSeo::class, Seo::class)`), and
 * overrides only the rules it needs to change. Every method receives the
 * Context, so a rule can look at the entry, the term, the request, and the
 * template's overrides. The traits only split the class into parts, so you
 * override their methods on the subclass, as you would any other. The sitemap
 * and the text files are built by Sitemap\Sitemap and TextFiles\TextFiles,
 * which call the hooks below.
 *
 * The methods marked `@api` (those that docs/developers.md lists) keep their
 * names and signatures until the next major version. The others are internal
 * and may change in any release.
