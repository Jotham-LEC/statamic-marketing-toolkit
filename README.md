# Marketing Toolkit


![The Marketing overview, with the SEO score, the failing checks, recent 404s, redirects, and the brand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jotham-LEC/statamic-marketing-toolkit/main/docs/images/overview.png)


SEO, redirects, 404s, SEO reports, tracking tags and Consent Mode for Statamic. Built for teams where marketing has ownership over SEO & Analytics, so that designers/developers can focus on app logic and design. 

## For marketers

- **SEO Control**: Modify SEO title, description, share image, canonical address, indexing, and structured data of every page, and a preview shows how the page will look in Google and on social media as you type.
- **Sensible Defaults**: Every page gets its tags, a sitemap, robots.txt, and llms.txt without anyone filling in a field.
- **Redirects & 404s**: Anyone can add redirects, wildcards and 410s included. Moving a page adds one for you, and missing pages are logged. Bulk import from a CSV.
- **SEO Score**: Every page is checked and scored out of 100. Each problem links straight to the entry that fixes it.
- **Front-end Toolbar**: Signed in, every page of the live site shows its score, failing checks, search preview, redirects and tracking, with a link to fix each.
- **Tracking Tags**: Paste your GTM, GA4, PostHog, Meta Pixel, or LinkedIn ID. Tags load on the live site only.
- **Integrations**: Search Console numbers per page, form submissions sent on as leads with their source, and UTM campaign links.
- **Consent Mode v2**: Works with the cookie banner you already have, with defaults per region.

## For developers

- **Statamic native**: Fieldsets, globals, forms, and tags. Your layout needs only two tags, `<s:mt:head />` and `<s:mt:body />`.
- **Lean**: No front-end script unless a feature needs one. Files are served without sessions or cookies.
- **Feature toggles**: Switch off what you don't use, and it isn't loaded at all.

How it works under the hood is in [For developers](https://github.com/Jotham-LEC/statamic-marketing-toolkit/blob/main/docs/developers.md).

## Screens

The preview updates as you type, for Google and for shares on Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and X.

## Requirements

- **PHP 8.3+** with `curl`, `dom`, `mbstring`, and `openssl`.
- **Statamic 6.34+**. Core is enough; multi-site needs Statamic Pro, as Statamic itself does.
- **A database** Laravel can migrate, even on a flat-file site, for redirects, the 404 log and reports. SQLite is fine.
- **A serializing cache store**: `file`, `redis`, `database`, or `memcached`, not `array`. Automatic redirects compare an entry with the copy loaded before it was edited.
- **`imagick`** for share cards and favicons. Without it, pages use their uploaded share image, and `gd` draws favicons from a PNG or JPEG.
- **Laravel's scheduler** for scheduled reports and the Search Console import. A queue worker is optional.

Details are in [Getting started](https://github.com/Jotham-LEC/statamic-marketing-toolkit/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#what-you-need).

## Installation

```bash
composer require jotham-lec/statamic-marketing-toolkit
php artisan migrate
php please mt:install
```

`php artisan migrate` creates the `mt_redirects`, `mt_404s`, `mt_reports`, `mt_report_pages` and `mt_search_stats` tables. `mt:install`:

- creates the **Brand** and **Marketing settings** global sets and their blueprints, using the first asset container for images (choose another with `--container=`)
- fills their empty fields with what the site already uses: the home page's description, and the control panel kept out of robots.txt
- gives each routed collection that has no blueprint yet one with an **SEO** tab (skip it with `--no-blueprints`), and names the blueprints you already have that lack it, without changing them
- names files in `public/`, such as a new site's `robots.txt` and empty `favicon.ico`, that the web server would serve instead of the add-on's, and offers to delete them

Running it again overwrites nothing. It adds only what is missing, such as the fields a newer version brings.

Then add one tag after `<meta charset>` and the viewport, and one right after `<body>`:

```blade
<s:mt:head />
<s:mt:body />
```

In Antlers, use `{{ mt:head }}` and `{{ mt:body }}`.

## Where things are

Everything is in the **Marketing** section of the control panel, after Statamic's own sections (each user can move it under Preferences → Nav):

| Screen | What's there |
|---|---|
| Overview | The latest score, recent 404s, redirects, Search Console clicks, and the files the site serves, with any file in `public/` that shadows one |
| Reports | Run a report, see each check and the pages it flagged, export a CSV, and schedule reports |
| Redirects | Add, import and export redirects |
| 404s | Missing pages real visitors hit, how often, and the last page that linked there |
| Search Console | Connect Google Search Console, step by step, and import its numbers |
| Brand | Title separator, default description and share image, icon, publisher, share-card colours |
| Settings | Tracking IDs, Consent Mode, leads, verification codes, robots.txt, ads.txt, and the feature switches |

Each entry's SEO fields and preview are on its **SEO** tab. Who sees which screen is set under **Users → Roles**, in the Marketing group.

## Scheduled tasks

Registered automatically, provided Laravel's scheduler is running:

| Command | When |
|---|---|
| `mt:report` | Off by default. Daily or weekly, at 03:00 unless you choose another time (Marketing → Reports → Settings) |
| `mt:search-console` | Daily, 04:30, once a Search Console property is connected |

## Security and privacy

- Visitors never see the toolbar. Its loader is the same 300 bytes for everyone, so pages stay safe to cache, and it asks the site about a page only for signed-in control panel users, checking the session and each permission.
- Every Marketing screen checks its permission: viewing, managing redirects, and running reports are separate.
- Tracking tags print only in production, never in Live Preview, and an ID that doesn't look like one is never printed.
- Copies of the site outside production are `noindex`, and their robots.txt disallows everything, so staging stays out of search results.
- The sitemap, robots.txt, share cards and favicons are served without a session or cookies.
- It sends nothing to me. What it sends to other services, such as IndexNow pings for changed pages (on by default, in production), is listed in [What it sends where](https://github.com/Jotham-LEC/statamic-marketing-toolkit/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#what-it-sends-where).

## How it compares with other add-ons

Statamic has great add-ons for each part of this. Pick them instead if:

- **You want first-party support.** SEO Pro is by the Statamic team. This is one developer's project, supported through GitHub issues.
- **You prefer one add-on per job.** Switched-off features here cost nothing, but the add-ons below do their jobs well.
- **You prefer hand-written code.** I build this with heavy AI assistance. Every change goes through the test suite and CI on SQLite and Postgres, but you should know.

| Add-on | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [SEO Pro](https://statamic.com/addons/statamic/seo-pro) | SEO, sitemap, redirects, 404s, and reports, by the Statamic team |
| [Advanced SEO](https://statamic.com/addons/aerni/advanced-seo) | SEO, sitemaps, redirects, social images, and multi-site |
| [Aardvark SEO](https://statamic.com/addons/justkidding96/aardvark-seo) | On-page SEO, schema, and redirects |
| [Redirect](https://statamic.com/addons/rias/redirect) | Redirects and 404s |
| [404 Logger](https://statamic.com/addons/stoffelio/404-logger) | A log of 404 requests |
| [Consent Manager](https://statamic.com/addons/kiwikiwi/consent-manager) | A cookie banner and consent for tracking scripts |
| [Favicons](https://statamic.com/addons/kiwikiwi/favicons) | Favicons from one image |
| [AB Tester](https://statamic.com/addons/thoughtco/statamic-ab-tester) | A/B experiments |
